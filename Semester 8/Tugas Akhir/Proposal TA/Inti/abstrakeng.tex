A Latin square of order $n$ is an $n\times n$ array on $n$ symbols such that each symbol appears exactly once in every row and column. We investigate commutative Latin squares constructed within the max-plus algebra framework, i.e., an idempotent semiring on $\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$ with $\oplus$ as maximum and $\otimes$ as addition. Our focus includes: (i) a formal definition of ``commutative Latin squares over max-plus algebra'' on finite symbol sets via a normalization scheme so that the operation maps back into the set; (ii) necessary/sufficient conditions for existence; (iii) explicit construction methods together with verification procedures; and (iv) case studies, initial enumeration, and accompanying algebraic properties. The expected contributions lie at the interface of combinatorial design (Latin squares/quasigroups) and tropical algebra, with potential applications to tropical scheduling and discrete-event system modeling.
