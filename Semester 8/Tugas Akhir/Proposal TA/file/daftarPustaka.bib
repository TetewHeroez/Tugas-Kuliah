ABSTRACT = {A square array whose all rows and columns are different permutations of the same length over the same symbol set is known as a Latin square. A Latin square may or may not be symmetric. For classification and enumeration purposes, symmetric, non-symmetric, conjugate symmetric, and totally symmetric Latin squares play vital roles. This article discusses the Eigenproblem of non-symmetric Latin squares in well known max-plus algebra. By defining a certain vector corresponding to each cycle of a permutation of the Latin square, we characterize and find the Eigenvalue as well as the possible Eigenvectors.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we consider the eigenproblems for Latin squares in a bipartite min-max-plus system. The focus is upon developing a new algorithm to compute the eigenvalue and eigenvectors (trivial and non-trivial) for Latin squares in a bipartite min-max-plus system. We illustrate the algorithm using some examples. The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB, using max-plus algebra toolbox. Computationally speaking, our algorithm has a clear advantage over the power algorithm presented by Subiono and van der Woude. Because our algorithm takes 0 . 088783 sec to solve the eigenvalue problem for Latin square presented in Example 2, while the compared one takes 1 . 718662 sec for the same problem. Furthermore, a time complexity comparison is presented, which reveals that the proposed algorithm is less time consuming when compared with some of the existing algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {The eigenproblem for matrices in max-plus algebra describes the steady state of the system, and therefore it has been intensively studied by many authors. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvectors of a square matrix in an iterative way. The algorithm is extended to compute the nontrivial eigenvectors for Latin squares in max-plus algebra.},
