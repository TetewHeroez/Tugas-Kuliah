# ðŸŽ“ ITS Mathematics Coursework Repository
<!-- PORTFOLIO-START: detailedDescription -->
This repository contains various academic assignments and coursework I completed throughout my undergraduate studies in the **Department of Mathematics**, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS). Most of the documents are written in **LaTeX** and exported as PDF files.

## ðŸ–‹ Why LaTeX?
<!-- PORTFOLIO-START: detailedDescription -->
I first got introduced to $\LaTeX$ while working as a **Staff Partner for OMITS 16th** in the Quality Management division. As someone who doesnâ€™t enjoy handwriting (and often makes typos too!), LaTeX has become a game-changer in how I handle assignmentsâ€”especially since my third semester. It offers clean, professional formatting and allows me to focus on content without worrying about layout.

Since then, LaTeX has been my primary tool for writing mathematical reports, papers, and homework assignments.

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repository is organized into folders, each representing a different course. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:
<!-- PORTFOLIO-START: features -->
- **`.tex` source files**
- **Final `.pdf` versions**
- **Supporting figures or code (if applicable)**
<!-- PORTFOLIO-END: features -->
Courses include, but are not limited to:

- **Calculus**
- **Linear Algebra**
- **Real Analysis**
- **Numerical Methods**
- **Abstract Algebra**
- **Probability & Statistics**
- **Mathematical Modeling**

Iâ€™ve also included short descriptions or reflections in some folders to help readers understand the focus and learning outcomes of each course.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All files are for educational and archival purposes only.
- Please donâ€™t copy-paste the work directly. Instead, use it as a reference or inspiration.
- If youâ€™re a fellow math student, I hope you find something helpful here!
