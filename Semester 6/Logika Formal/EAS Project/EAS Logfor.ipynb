    "There is we got some problem because the robot can move in three directions, so the robot have minimum and maximum steps to reach the destination. If we analyze the grid, we can see that the minimum steps is $4+2=6$ steps (4 steps in diagonal and 2 steps in horizontal) and obviously the maximum steps is $10$ steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this case, we assume that don't know the minimum steps. So the program must be able to check from 1 until 10, but not all of them will be satisfiable. Therefore, if the iteration of minimum steps are satisfiable, we can check the model and print all the paths."
